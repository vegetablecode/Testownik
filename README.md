# Testownik

## What is it?
This is an app for practising tests. This is my first app created in JavaFX.

## Features
* support for multiple answers
* support for image questions and image answers
* number of repetitions for wrong-answered questions
* progress bar

## Project status
This project is not finished yet. You can solve the tests, get the points, repete wrong-answered questions, etc. But there are some things to do:
- [ ] summary after finishing the test
- [ ] settings menu, where you can for example change the number of repetitions
- [ ] timer that shows study time
- [ ] question generator
- [ ] showing good answers in "image quesions"
- [ ] "skip the question" option
- [ ] some styling in css (dark theme, etc.)

I'm a bit bored with this project, but maybe in the future I'm gonna finish it. I think it's almost done.
